Info:

    phpfs is a FUSE-based filesystem that uses HTTP messages to mount a remote
    location on a local machine, relying on a generated PHP script installed on
    the remote machine.

Install:

    1. Resolve dependencies and add current user to the fuse group as described in  
       the "Prepare enviroinment" paragraph.

    2. Install:

	    $ make
	    # make install

    3. If needed, uninstall:

	    # make uninstall

Sample usage:

    1. Generate the PHP script:

           $ phpfs generate > phpfs.php

    2. Place the generated script in an accessible location inside the document
       root of your web server.

    3. Mount the remote filesystem:

           $ mkdir /tmp/phpfs/
           $ phpfs mount http://target.com/phpfs.php /tmp/phpfs/ /home/john/

    4. Now the remote /home/john/ is mounted in /tmp/phpfs/, head there to
       browse the remote files.

    5. Unmount the filesystem:

           $ fusermount -u /tmp/phpfs/

Prepare the enviroinment:

    1. Install dependencies

	    fuse
	    libfuse-dev
	    libcurl4-openssl-dev
	    cmake

    2. Make sure the current user is in the fuse group (this preliminary step is
       mandatory to use any FUSE filesystem):

           # adduser john fuse

       Then log out and back in or start a new shell with:

           $ newgrp fuse

       to inform the system about the changes.
