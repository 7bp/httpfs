httpfs - Remote FUSE filesystem via server-side script
======================================================

httpfs is a FUSE-based filesystem that uses HTTP messages to mount a remote
directory on a local machine, relying on a generated server-side script
(e.g. PHP) installed on the server.

Setup
-----

 1. Resolve dependencies and add the current user to the `fuse` group as
    described in the **Prepare the environment** paragraph.

 2. Install:

        $ make
        # make install

 3. If needed, uninstall:

        # make uninstall

Sample usage
------------

 1. Generate a PHP script:

        $ httpfs generate php > httpfs.php

 2. Place the generated script in an accessible location inside the document
    root of your web server.

 3. Mount the remote filesystem:

        $ mkdir /tmp/httpfs/
        $ httpfs mount http://target.com/httpfs.php /tmp/httpfs/ /home/john/

 4. Now the remote `/home/john/` is mounted in `/tmp/httpfs/`, head there to
    browse the remote files.

 5. Unmount the filesystem:

        $ fusermount -u /tmp/httpfs/

Prepare the environment
-----------------------

 1. Install dependencies:

        fuse
        libfuse-dev
        libcurl4-openssl-dev
        cmake

 2. Make sure the current user is in the `fuse` group (this preliminary step is
    mandatory to use any FUSE filesystem):

        # adduser john fuse

    Then log out and back in or start a new shell with:

        $ newgrp fuse

    to inform the system about the changes.
